# 🏋️‍♂️ GymHub – React + Vite
## 🚀 Project Idea

- GymHub is a fitness club management app that provides two main roles:

# 👤 User

- Register and log in to the system.

- View personal details and unique User ID.

- Check whether they are Subscribed or Not Subscribed.

- 🛡️ Admin

- Fetch and display a user’s data by entering their User ID in a form.

- Create bookings through a dedicated booking form.

- Manage users, view their subscription status, and handle reservations.

## ⚙️ How It Works

- Users register, log in, and access their personal data.

- The system shows subscription status (Subscribed ✅ / Not Subscribed ❌).

- Admin dashboard includes buttons to:

- Open a form to enter a User ID and fetch the user’s data.

- Open a booking form and create a new booking for that user.
