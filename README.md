# 🏋️‍♂️ GymHub – React + Vite

---

## 🚀 Project Idea

**GymHub** is a fitness club management app that allows users to:

- **Browse available gyms and facilities**  
- **Book training sessions or specific equipment**  
- **Track their fitness progress and stats**  

Administrators can **manage gyms, equipment, and bookings** easily through a dedicated admin panel.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

- Users access the app, explore gyms and services, and make bookings.  
- Bookings and user data are temporarily stored in `localStorage` (with the possibility to connect to a backend later).  
- Admins can view all bookings, manage equipment, and monitor members’ progress.
